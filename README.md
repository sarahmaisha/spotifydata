** How do you see OpenSesame fitting into your career journey or long-term goals? **

As a Computer Science major with a Data Science minor at Arizona State University, OpenSesame fits directly into my goal of becoming a software engineer who builds intelligent systems that improve how people learn, grow, and do meaningful work. I’m especially motivated by work that blends software engineering, AI, and real-world human impact. Through my academic and research experiences, I’ve learned that the most impactful technology doesn’t just solve technical problems, but it enables people to adapt and succeed in the ever-growing society. OpenSesame’s mission to upskill global workforces using AI-powered learning aligns strongly with how I want to apply my technical skills long term. This internship would allow me to grow as an engineer in a production SaaS environment while contributing to systems that make learning more accessible, personalized, and scalable.



** What strengths, skills, or perspectives will you bring to OpenSesame to make an impact and contribute to our mission?**

I bring a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals, hands-on experience with AI-driven systems, and a mindset shaped by collaboration and continuous learning. Currently, I work as a research assistant, where I have gotten my hands on many different AI models, such as one to optimize natural-language-to-formal-logic translation systems using LLMs such as GPT and LLaMA. This work has given me experience designing backend tools, improving workflows, and thinking critically about how AI can meaningfully assist developers rather than simply automate tasks. In addition, my project work from building interactive learning-focused web applications to developing ML pipelines with CNN-LSTM, U-Net, and YOLO has taught me how to translate abstract ideas into real-world software. As a math tutor, I’ve also learned how to communicate complex ideas clearly and empathetically, a skill that translates well to pair programming and cross-team collaboration. Whether working with frontend tools like React, backend logic in Python or C++, or infrastructure concepts, I’m eager to contribute thoughtfully while continuously improving both my technical skills and the systems I work on.



** What excites you most about working with AI, and how do you think it can shape the future of learning and work?**

What excites me most about AI is its potential to augment human learning rather than replace it. I’m particularly interested in how AI can provide the right learning opportunities at the right time. At OpenSesame, AI has the opportunity to transform learning into a dynamic, skills-based journey rather than a static experience. Having worked directly with AI systems in research and applied projects, I’m excited to contribute to building AI that is practical and makes learning easier and accessible to modern society.
